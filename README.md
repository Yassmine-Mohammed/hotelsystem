# Hotel Management System

## Overview
This Hotel Management System is a console-based application developed as part of the Winter Camp 2025 project. It is designed to handle essential hotel operations such as inventory management, billing, room reservations, and food & beverage orders. The focus of the project is on functional programming and clean, straightforward code.

## Features
- **Inventory Management:** Track and update hotel supplies (e.g., food ingredients) in real-time.
- **Billing System:** Calculate and generate invoices including room charges and restaurant orders with tax.
- **Room Reservation:** Manage room booking details and calculate the total cost based on stay duration.
- **Food and Beverage Orders:** Display a menu, process meal orders, and update the inventory accordingly.
- **Interactive Console Interface:** Utilizes text effects (e.g., typewriter effect and color changes) to enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** (Console-based implementation)
- **Standard Libraries:** `iostream`, `map`, `algorithm`, `thread`, and `chrono`

## How to Run
### Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Yassmine/Hotel-Management-System.git
```
### Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o hotel_management
```
### Run the executable:
```sh
./hotel_management
```

## Future Enhancements
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved usability.
- Introduce persistent data storage to save inventory and reservation details.
- Add advanced error handling and user input validation.

This project is a stepping stone toward real-world software development, emphasizing practical programming skills and user interaction via a console application. Contributions and feedback are always welcome! ðŸš€
